Welcome to Stefan Kreidels tech blog. I try my best to make sure that the discussions on my posts are troll, spam and abuse free but I am not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction between you and me, and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:

- Be polite – don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you would say would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.
- Don’t troll. I appreciate and welcome criticism towards myself or the content of my posts, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.
- Spam? Goodbye. I understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, however, I am not interested. Please refrain from posting or I will give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.

If you find any comments which violate these guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – I highly appreciate your support!

**Happy commenting!**
